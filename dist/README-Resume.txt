# Add your resume PDF here

To fix "Failed to load PDF document":

1. Copy your resume PDF into this folder (`portfolio-react/public/`).
2. Rename it exactly to: **Sarath_Sasidharan_QA_Engineer_Resume.pdf**
   - If your file is named `Sarath_Sasidharan_QA_Engineer_Resume.pdf.pdf`, rename it to remove the extra `.pdf`.

After that, the "Download Resume" button will download the file instead of showing an error.
